## Overview
This was fundamentally an exercise in async programming in C# and managing data permissions within a project. While also leaning the fundamentals for WPF.

## "Take-aways"
Overall I really enjoyed working on this mini project and feel that it has helped me practice several skils including:
- C#
- Async Programming
- Event-Driven Programming

on top of this it has allowed me to begin to develop a few new skills including:
- xaml
- use of WPF

## Extra notes
as a plan moving forward I intend to implement this same program as a static webpage in order to practice JS, on top of this I have been inspired to attempt to build a few more small projects; including Battle Ships.
